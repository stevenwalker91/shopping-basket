# Shopping Basket

Another project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart) curriculum. The scope of this project was to create a shopping basket app where users could add items to the basket.

## What's new/what did I learn

This was my first time using react router and the react testing library to do unit testing. I felt on this one I really started to get to grip with React and using functional components. One of the areas I'm still not 100% is effective mocking of unit tests, as well as where to draw the line with testing across parent/children components. I suspect this will come with time and experience. 


## Other Comments

Given the primary objective of the project was react router and unit testing, I haven't focused too much on styling. For example, it's not particularly pretty. I used a free API for the shop data, but the data quality isn't great, however it was the best I could do with free APIs that didn't require authentication.
